#Remove Certificate Overrides
Adds an option to remove all certificate overrides from Firefox for Android.

To compile the addon, get yourself the Mozilla Add-on SDK from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm#Installation and run "jpm xpi" in the main add-on directory.
Or just download the ready-built version from here ;-)
